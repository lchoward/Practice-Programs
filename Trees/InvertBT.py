# Invert a binary tree.

# Example:

# Input:

#      4
#    /   \
#   2     7
#  / \   / \
# 1   3 6   9
# Output:

#      4
#    /   \
#   7     2
#  / \   / \
# 9   6 3   1
# Trivia:
# This problem was inspired by this original tweet by Max Howell:
#
# Google: 90% of our engineers use the software you wrote (Homebrew),
# but you canâ€™t invert a binary tree on a whiteboard so f*** off.

# approach:
# run dfs on root, inverting left and right children of the node each time
# return root
# run-time: O(N)
# space: O(N) if needed O(1) could use a while loop?

# Definition for a binary tree node.

    def __init__(self, x):
